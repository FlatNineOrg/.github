We _rapidly_ build _profitable_ software products
-------------------------------------------------



### A note from our founder

In a world where information is widely available and very fragmented, we strive to create systems and relationships so that the information you have becomes more meaningful and clear, allowing you to inform your decisions.

We are a small boutique company, 100% bootstrapped, that specialize in rapidly building multiple profitable software products (SaaS) by collecting third-party data in several industries.

### Velocity
 
Velocity is declined in many ways in our day-to-day work: we go to market as fast as we can, we try to ship features fairly fast, we try to have a minimal turnaround time on support tickets.

We keep our team small so that we can ship features faster than bigger corporations. Velocity is one of our competitive edges.

### Multiplicity

We **don't focus on one thing**. We try to create new autonomous, loosely interconnected projects by subtracting features from existing projects and starting new niche-focused tools where those features become core.

We were inspired by reading about the idea of a [rhizome](https://blog.flatnine.co/rhizomatic-approach-business/), a philosophical concept developed by French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari.

### Bootstrapped & Profit First

We ensure we have **no or little overhead** so that we can pay ourselves first and ensure the survival of the business. All of our solutions are built with an initial capital of less than $100. We also actively avoid working with investors.

By operating this way we are able to reach profitability from day 1, every time we start a new project. We are also able to approach problems creatively, instead of just throwing money at them.

### Truly AI-driven

Our AI CEO bot, Brain, can access vast troves of data and possess an intimate understanding of our market, financials, and ongoing projects. We already delegate major decisions to Brain, which is equipped with insights surpassing our own. We also heavily employ AI to reduce stress on the humans working in the company.
